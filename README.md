# 🧠 Operating Systems Lab in C (OSL-C)

Welcome to the **Operating Systems Lab** repository! 🖥️  
This repository includes various **OS-based programs implemented in C**, covering core concepts such as process scheduling, memory management, synchronization, and system calls.

---

## 📘 About

This repository serves as a hands-on resource for understanding key **Operating System principles** through practical **C programs**. Ideal for students, developers, and anyone interested in systems programming.

---

## 🔍 Key Topics Covered

### 🧾 Process Management
- `FCFS_10.c`: First Come First Serve scheduling
- `FIFO.c`: Page replacement using FIFO algorithm
- `FSFC.c`: File system with First Fit allocation
- `First_Fit.c`: Memory allocation using First Fit
- `Bankers_Algorithm.c`: Deadlock avoidance using Banker’s algorithm

### 🔁 Process Creation & Termination
- `Exp-04(Fork).c`: Demonstration of `fork()` system call
- `Exp-04(Wait).c`: Use of `wait()` and `exit()` for child-parent synchronization

### 🔄 Synchronization
- `Producers_Consumers.c`: Producer-Consumer problem using semaphores

### 🖥️ Shell Scripting
- `EXP_02.sh`: Shell script demonstrating basic Linux commands
- `Basic_Terminal_Commands/`: Collection of commonly used Linux terminal commands

### 📊 Experiments
- `Experiment-03.c`: Custom logic (based on course experiments)

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- GCC Compiler (e.g., `sudo apt install build-essential`)
- Linux OS (recommended)
- Basic understanding of C and system calls

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Compilation & Execution

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
````

For shell scripts:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```
